## Overall Architecture

The project follows a full-stack architecture with a clear separation between the frontend and backend. The frontend is built using React, while the backend is developed using Express.js. The backend connects to a MongoDB database to store and retrieve data. The frontend and backend communicate via RESTful APIs.

### Frontend-Backend Communication

The frontend communicates with the backend using HTTP requests. The backend exposes various RESTful API endpoints that the frontend can call to perform CRUD operations. For example, when a user wants to fetch posts, the frontend sends a GET request to the backend's `/posts` endpoint. Similarly, for creating a new post, the frontend sends a POST request to the backend's `/posts` endpoint with the post data.

### Main Technologies and Libraries

  - React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - React Router: For handling routing in the React application.
  - Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
  - react-query: For data fetching and state management.

- **Backend:**
  - Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js.
  - Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
  - ImageKit: For handling image uploads and transformations.
  - Clerk: For authentication and user management.

- **Database:**
  - MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing application data.

- **Environment Management:**
